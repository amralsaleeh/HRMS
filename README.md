## Getting Started

### Requirements

- PHP 8.1 or later
- Composer
- MySQL
- Node.js and npm (for frontend assets - optional if assets are already compiled)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amralsaleeh/HRMS.git
   cd HRMS
   ```

2. **Install PHP dependencies:**

   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

3. **Create the database:**

   Create a MySQL database for the application. For example:
   
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE hrms_database;
   ```

4. **Configure environment variables:**

   Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:
   
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   
   Open the `.env` file and configure the following:
   - `DB_CONNECTION=mysql`
   - `DB_HOST=127.0.0.1`
   - `DB_PORT=3306`
   - `DB_DATABASE=hrms_database` (or your database name)
   - `DB_USERNAME=your_database_username`
   - `DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password`
   - `APP_TIMEZONE=Asia/Istanbul` (or your preferred timezone)

5. **Generate application key:**

   ```bash
   php artisan key:generate
   ```

6. **Create storage link:**

   ```bash
   php artisan storage:link
   ```

7. **Run database migrations and seeders:**

   This will create all necessary tables and populate them with initial data including a default admin user:
   
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate --seed
   ```

8. **Install frontend dependencies (optional):**

   If you need to compile or modify frontend assets:
   
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
   
   Note: If the assets are already compiled in `public/assets/`, you can skip this step.

9. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   php artisan serve
   ```

10. **Access the application:**

    Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`

### Default Login Credentials

After running the migrations with seeders, you can log in using the following default admin credentials:

- **Email:** `admin@demo.com`
- **Password:** `admin`

**Important:** Change the default password after your first login for security purposes.
